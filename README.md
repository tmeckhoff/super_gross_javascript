# super_gross_javascript
This was a pair-programming assignment where we were given the following instructions:

"Ok, so what you will need to do. Create a button on the DOM that reads "Generate".
When the page loads, you will need to send to the client three different JSON files. The generate button should not work until all three pieces of JSON received from the server.

List 1 should be a 'Modifying Adjective", examples : "Super", "Really" 
List 2 should be an Adjective, example "Lame", "Boring"
List 3 should be any of the topics we have covered, "Arrays", "Objects", "Build Automation"

Once the generate button is clicked, pick a random spot on each of the arrays and construct a string that is then appended to the DOM. If the generate button is clicked again, the old string should be removed and a new one should take its place.

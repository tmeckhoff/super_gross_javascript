# super_gross_javascript
This was a pair-programming assignment where we were given the following instructions:

"Or, maybe "Random Prime Venting Generator"?
Ok, so what you will need to do. Create a button on the DOM that reads "Generate".
When the page loads, you will need to send to the client three different JSON files. The generate button should not work until all three pieces of JSON received from the server.

List 1 should be a 'Modifying Adjective", examples : "Super", "Really" 
List 2 should be an Adjective, example "Lame", "Boring"
List 3 should be any of the topics we have covered, "Arrays", "Objects", "Build Automation"

Once the generate button is clicked, pick a random spot on each of the arrays and construct a string that is then appended to the DOM. If the generate button is clicked again, the old string should be removed and a new one should take its place. 

Post the whole application to Heroku. Note: No Hard or Pro mode. Once you are complete, you are clear to upgrade your application however you wish OR help other groups that might be having a difficult time.

HOWEVER, 

Before you get started, you and your pair need to talk through how to build the whole application. Talk through each of the logic points and complete a write of up each. Try to describe how you will build and implement each of the pieces of functionality in the application."
